# Return the "centered" average of an array of ints, which we'll say is the mean average of the values, 
# except ignoring the largest and smallest values in the array. 

# what do we do if smallest or largest is duplicated
# - we only consider 1 of smallest and 1 of largest to be valid

# what data type are we expecting to return?
# int / float?
# return an int

# centered_average([1, 2, 3, 4, 100]) → 3 >>> [2, 3, 4, 100] -> [2, 3, 4] -> 2 + 3 + 4 => 9 / 3 => 3
# centered_average([1, 1, 5, 5, 10, 8, 7]) → 5 >>> [1, 5, 5, 10, 8, 7] -> [1, 5, 5, 8, 7] -> 1 + 5 + 5 + 8 + 7 => 26 / 5
# centered_average([-10, -4, -2, -4, -2, 0]) → -3 >>> [-4, -2, -4, -2, 0] -> [-4, -2, -4, -2]  => -4 + -2 + -4 + -2 => -12 / 4 => -3

# centered_average([1, 2, 3, 4, 100]) -> 3 >>> [1, 2, 3, 4, 100] -> 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 100 => 110 => 110 - max => 10 - min => 9 / 3 => 3
# max = 100
# min = 1
